# IntegrationOS (Now Pica)

IntegrationOS has rebranded to **Pica** to reflect our evolved mission and vision. While the name has changed, our commitment remains the same: to build the essential infrastructure that empowers the next evolution of autonomous AI.

As Pica, we are focused on:

1. **Seamless API and tool integration** for AI agents.
2. **Transparent, auditable actions** to ensure trust and accountability.
3. **Human-aligned systems** that prioritize meaningful and responsible outcomes.

This rebranding represents our dedication to driving impactful innovation and fostering trust in autonomous AI systems. Thank you for being part of our journey.
